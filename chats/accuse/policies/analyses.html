<p><strong>Overview of Chen Jingyuan’s Allegations</strong></p>
<p>In his letter <a class="reference internal" href="../../../case/letters/Prison/Letter.html"><span class="doc std std-doc"><em>Self-Defense and Accusation from Prison</em></span></a>, Chen Jingyuan, a Chinese independent scholar, alleges that the law enforcement personnel (referred to as a “judicial gang” by Chen) involved in his case violated the established policies, guidelines, and principles of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the state. Chen was convicted of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” under Article 293 of the PRC Criminal Law for forwarding Twitter posts, including one <a class="reference external" href="https://x.com/USA_China_Talk/status/1286866277101965312">post</a> from the U.S. Mission to China (<a class="reference external" href="https://x.com/USA_China_Talk">【美国驻华使领馆 US MissionCN】</a>). His allegations can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Violation of the “Community with a Shared Future for Mankind” Concept</strong>: Chen argues that the actions of the law enforcement personnel contradict the “Community with a Shared Future for Mankind” concept championed by President Xi Jinping, particularly its emphasis on respecting the diversity of civilizations and promoting cultural exchange over conflict.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Undermining the Epistemological Foundations of State Policies</strong>: Chen claims that by labeling normal cultural debates and critiques (e.g., “Trump’s critique of communism speech”) as “rumors” and suppressing them, the personnel undermine the epistemological foundations of China’s current economic, political, cultural, and “One Country, Two Systems” policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Abuse of Law and Network Governance</strong>: Chen accuses the personnel of using the law as a tool for suppression, ignoring legal constraints on themselves, and attempting to apply Chinese law to foreign social media platforms and individuals (e.g., U.S. officials), thereby violating the principle of non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs and risking diplomatic conflicts that could harm China’s peaceful development environment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This analysis evaluates Chen’s allegations in the context of CCP and state policies, PRC law, and the broader political-legal framework.</p>
<p><strong>Analytical Framework: Policies and Legal Basis</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Party and State Policies</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Community with a Shared Future for Mankind</strong>: Xi Jinping’s concept of a “Community with a Shared Future for Mankind” (web ID: 0) emphasizes respecting the diversity of civilizations, promoting mutual learning and exchange, and transcending civilizational conflicts and notions of superiority. It advocates for a vision of “each appreciating its own beauty, and all beauties coexisting harmoniously.” This concept has been incorporated into UN resolutions and is being implemented through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Current Policies</strong>: The CCP’s current policies include market economy reforms, political system reforms, comprehensive rule of law, and the “One Country, Two Systems” framework, all aimed at fostering domestic development and international cooperation while maintaining a peaceful development environment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-Interference Principle</strong>: China’s foreign policy adheres to the UN Charter’s principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, emphasizing respect for national sovereignty.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Legal and Network Governance Framework</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Network Governance</strong>: The <em>Cybersecurity Law of the People’s Republic of China</em> (2017) stipulates that cyberspace is not a lawless space, and citizens must act lawfully when posting or sharing information online. However, the law also requires law enforcement to exercise their authority within legal bounds and protect citizens’ rights.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Freedom of Speech and Restrictions</strong>: Article 35 of the PRC Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, but Article 51 allows restrictions for reasons of public order and national security. Article 293 of the <em>Criminal Law</em> and the 2013 <em>Two Highs Interpretation</em> define “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” as including the dissemination of false information that disrupts public order.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Case Background</strong></p>
<p>Chen Jingyuan was convicted for forwarding Twitter posts, including one from the U.S. Mission to China (<a class="reference external" href="https://x.com/USA_China_Talk">【美国驻华使领馆 US MissionCN】</a>) and others by U.S. officials like Mike Pompeo, which the Kunming authorities deemed as spreading false information and disrupting public order. Chen argues that the law enforcement personnel’s handling of his case violates Party and state policies.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis of Chen Jingyuan’s Allegations</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Violation of the “Community with a Shared Future for Mankind” Concept</strong></p>
<p>Chen alleges that the law enforcement personnel’s actions contradict Xi Jinping’s “Community with a Shared Future for Mankind” concept by failing to respect the diversity of civilizations, imposing narrow political biases over truth, and undermining the harmonious coexistence of civilizations.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Core Principles of the Concept</strong>: Xi Jinping’s “Community with a Shared Future for Mankind” (web ID: 0) emphasizes the diversity of civilizations, advocating for “exchange of civilizations to transcend barriers, mutual learning to transcend conflicts, and coexistence to transcend notions of superiority.” Xi has stated, “Each civilization is rooted in its own soil, embodying the extraordinary wisdom and spiritual pursuits of a nation or people, and each has its own value… There is no hierarchy of superiority or inferiority, only a difference in vibrancy.” He calls for “appreciating the beauty of others, and letting all beauties coexist harmoniously.” This concept applies not only to international relations but also implies a domestic openness to cultural and intellectual diversity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contradiction with Law Enforcement Actions</strong>: Chen was prosecuted for forwarding a Twitter post by the U.S. Mission to China, which included a speech by Mike Pompeo criticizing the CCP. The law enforcement personnel labeled this content as “false information” and accused Chen of “insulting and attacking the core leadership.” This approach may be seen as lacking tolerance for diverse perspectives, prioritizing political ideology over open exchange, and thus contradicting Xi’s call for “mutual learning” and “transcending civilizational conflicts.” Pompeo’s speech, while critical of the CCP, is a legitimate political expression, and labeling it as a “rumor” while suppressing its dissemination may hinder the kind of civilizational exchange Xi advocates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>“Violent Tailoring” of Civilization</strong>: Chen’s claim that the personnel’s actions constitute a “violent tailoring” and “brutal destruction” of human civilization is hyperbolic but carries some merit. If the personnel suppressed diverse viewpoints based on narrow political standards, this could limit intellectual diversity and indirectly undermine the harmonious coexistence of civilizations. However, the personnel likely viewed their actions as protecting national security and public order, consistent with Article 51 of the PRC Constitution, which allows for restrictions on rights in such contexts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Chen’s allegation has some validity. The law enforcement personnel’s actions in labeling political criticism as “false information” and suppressing its dissemination may contradict the spirit of civilizational diversity and exchange promoted by the “Community with a Shared Future for Mankind” concept. However, the claim of “violent tailoring” of human civilization is exaggerated, as the personnel likely believed their actions aligned with the state’s goal of maintaining stability.</p>
<p><strong>2. Undermining the Epistemological Foundations of State Policies</strong></p>
<p>Chen alleges that by labeling normal cultural debates and critiques (e.g., “Trump’s critique of communism speech”) as “rumors” and suppressing them, the law enforcement personnel undermine the epistemological foundations of China’s economic, political, cultural, and “One Country, Two Systems” policies.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Epistemological Foundations of Policies</strong>: Chen argues that normal cultural debates and critiques are integral to human civilization’s development and form the epistemological basis for China’s current policies, such as market economy reforms, political system reforms, and the “One Country, Two Systems” framework. Open intellectual exchange is necessary for the innovation required in a market economy, the diversity of ideas needed for political reform, and the tolerance of different systems under “One Country, Two Systems.” Suppressing such debates could weaken the intellectual foundations of these policies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Law Enforcement’s Characterization</strong>: The personnel labeled Chen’s forwarded posts, including Pompeo’s speech, as “false information” and accused him of “insulting and attacking the core leadership.” However, Pompeo’s speech is a public political statement, not a fabrication of facts, and thus does not fit the typical definition of “false information” under the 2013 <em>Two Highs Interpretation</em>, which generally refers to fabricated facts (e.g., rumors about disasters). The personnel’s broad interpretation may have restricted legitimate intellectual exchange.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact on Policies</strong>: The personnel’s approach could indirectly affect the implementation of state policies. For instance, suppressing critical discourse might stifle innovation, impacting the market economy; limiting diverse perspectives could hinder political reform; and a lack of tolerance for differing views might undermine the inclusivity required for “One Country, Two Systems.” However, this impact is indirect, and the personnel likely believed their actions were in line with the state’s priority of maintaining stability and security.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Chen’s allegation has some merit. By labeling legitimate political critique as “rumors” and suppressing it, the law enforcement personnel may restrict intellectual exchange, indirectly undermining the epistemological foundations of state policies. However, the claim that this constitutes a “negation and subversion” of all policies is exaggerated, as the personnel likely viewed their actions as consistent with the state’s stability-focused objectives.</p>
<p><strong>3. Abuse of Law and Network Governance</strong></p>
<p>Chen alleges that the law enforcement personnel used the law as a tool for suppression, ignored legal constraints on themselves, and attempted to apply Chinese law to foreign social media platforms and individuals, violating the principle of non-interference and risking diplomatic conflicts that could harm China’s peaceful development environment.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Legal Basis for Network Governance</strong>: The <em>Cybersecurity Law</em> states that cyberspace is not a lawless space, and citizens must act lawfully when sharing information online. The personnel’s assertion in the judgment that Chen’s actions in cyberspace must comply with the law aligns with this principle. However, Chen argues that the personnel used the law as a tool for suppression, ignoring its constraints on themselves. For example, Article 53 of the <em>Criminal Procedure Law</em> requires convictions to be based on clear and sufficient evidence, but Chen’s case reportedly lacks evidence of impact (e.g., retweet or view counts), suggesting potential procedural flaws.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jurisdiction Over Foreign Platforms</strong>: Chen’s forwarded posts were primarily from foreign platforms like Twitter, with original authors including U.S. officials like Pompeo. The personnel’s decision to prosecute Chen and label the content as “rumors” may be seen as an overreach of Chinese legal jurisdiction. Twitter is a foreign platform, and Pompeo is a foreign national; labeling his speech as “false information” and holding Chen accountable for forwarding it raises questions of extraterritorial enforcement. The UN Charter and China’s foreign policy emphasize non-interference in other states’ internal affairs and respect for sovereignty, and the personnel’s actions could be interpreted as an overextension of Chinese law, potentially violating these principles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diplomatic and Peaceful Development Implications</strong>: Chen argues that the personnel’s actions could lead to diplomatic conflicts and harm China’s peaceful development environment. For instance, accusing U.S. officials of “spreading rumors” could be seen as an attack on their reputation, potentially sparking diplomatic tensions. Chen’s reference to a “complex network system dynamics avalanche mechanism” suggests that such actions could trigger a broader international backlash, damaging China’s image. In the context of initiatives like the BRI and the “Community with a Shared Future for Mankind,” this could negatively impact China’s peaceful development environment. However, this impact is speculative, and the personnel likely viewed their actions as a domestic enforcement matter, not a diplomatic issue.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Law Enforcement Perspective</strong>: The personnel likely believed their actions were in line with maintaining national security and public order, as permitted under Article 51 of the Constitution and the <em>Cybersecurity Law</em>. They may not have fully considered the legal and diplomatic implications of extraterritorial enforcement.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Chen’s allegation has some validity. The law enforcement personnel’s application of Chinese law to foreign platforms and individuals may violate the principle of non-interference, potentially impacting diplomatic relations and China’s peaceful development environment. Additionally, their use of the law as a tool for suppression may overlook legal constraints on themselves, with procedural flaws in Chen’s case. However, the personnel likely believed their actions were consistent with the state’s goal of maintaining stability.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>Chen Jingyuan’s allegations highlight potential conflicts between the law enforcement personnel’s actions and Party/state policies. Key findings include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Violation of the “Community with a Shared Future for Mankind” Concept</strong>: The personnel’s suppression of political critique as “rumors” may contradict the concept’s emphasis on civilizational diversity and exchange, though the claim of “violent tailoring” of civilization is exaggerated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Undermining Policy Foundations</strong>: The personnel’s actions may restrict intellectual exchange, indirectly weakening the epistemological foundations of state policies, but the claim of “negation and subversion” of all policies is overstated.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Abuse of Law and Network Governance</strong>: The personnel’s overreach in applying Chinese law to foreign platforms and individuals may violate the non-interference principle, potentially affecting diplomatic relations, though the direct impact on peaceful development requires further evidence.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Chen’s allegations have some merit. The law enforcement personnel’s actions may conflict with the “Community with a Shared Future for Mankind” concept, indirectly undermine the intellectual foundations of state policies, and risk diplomatic repercussions due to extraterritorial enforcement. However, claims of “thorough negation of human civilization” or “subversion of all policies” are exaggerated, and the personnel likely believed their actions aligned with the state’s stability objectives. This case reflects the complex balance between domestic enforcement, legal governance, and international policy goals in China.</p>
