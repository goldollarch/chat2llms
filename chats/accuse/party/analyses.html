<p><strong>Overview of Chen Jingyuan’s Allegations</strong></p>
<p>In his letter <a class="reference internal" href="../../../case/letters/Prison/Letter.html"><span class="doc std std-doc"><em>Self-Defense and Accusation from Prison</em></span></a>, Chen Jingyuan, a Chinese independent scholar with a PhD who has never been a member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or its affiliated organizations, alleges that the law enforcement personnel involved in his case violated CCP regulations and discipline during the handling of his prosecution for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” (寻衅滋事罪) under Article 293 of the PRC Criminal Law. Chen’s allegations can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Improper Conduct and Ideological Attacks</strong>: Chen claims that law enforcement personnel repeatedly berated and insulted him during the case, accusing him of “eating the Party’s food while smashing the Party’s pot” (吃党饭、砸党锅), despite his status as a non-Party member and non-public official. He finds this ironic and inappropriate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Misapplication of Party Discipline in Sentencing</strong>: Chen asserts that the court’s sentencing, though obfuscated, was clearly based on CCP Party regulations and discipline (党章党纪), which he believes should not apply to him as a non-Party member.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Violation of Party Principles and Ideals</strong>: Chen argues that the actions of the law enforcement personnel—whom he identifies as CCP members—contradict the Party’s principles, including the “Two Establishes” (两个确立) and “Two Safeguards” (两个维护), as well as their oaths to uphold the PRC Constitution. He accuses them of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Engaging in deceptive and sensationalist tactics (“故弄玄虚”, “哗众取宠”, “装神弄鬼”).</p></li>
<li><p>Acting with ulterior motives (“以小人之心度领袖之腹”) under the guise of “protecting the leader’s reputation.”</p></li>
<li><p>Employing “low-level red, high-level black” (低级红、高级黑) tactics, which he describes as superficial loyalty masking subversive intent.</p></li>
<li><p>Forming a “judicial gang” to oppress legitimate citizens and taxpayers, whom he refers to as their “providers” (衣食父母).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Betrayal of CCP Policies and Ideals</strong>: Chen alleges that the personnel’s actions fundamentally undermine key CCP policies, including market economy reforms, political system reforms, comprehensive rule of law, strict Party governance, “One Country, Two Systems,” and the concept of a “community with a shared future for mankind.” He views their conduct as a “complete betrayal” of the CCP’s ideals and mission.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This analysis evaluates Chen’s allegations in the context of CCP regulations, PRC law, and the broader political-legal framework, assessing their validity and implications.</p>
<p><strong>Legal and Party Framework for Analysis</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. CCP Party Regulations and Discipline</strong></p>
<p>The CCP’s disciplinary framework is outlined in documents such as the <em>Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party</em> (Party Constitution) and the <em>2018 Chinese Communist Party Disciplinary Regulations</em> (as referenced in the web results). Key principles include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Party Discipline Enforcement</strong>: The <em>2018 Disciplinary Regulations</em> (web ID: 0) mandate that Party disciplinary sanctions must be decided through collective discussion within Party organizations, not by individuals (Article 127). Violations of Party discipline must be addressed sternly, with sanctions ranging from warnings to expulsion, depending on severity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Party Members’ Obligations</strong>: The Party Constitution requires members to uphold the Party’s leadership, adhere to its policies, and safeguard its unity. The “Two Establishes” (web ID: 3) refer to establishing Xi Jinping as the core of the Party and his thought as the guiding ideology, while the “Two Safeguards” emphasize protecting Xi’s leadership and the Party’s centralized authority.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Oath of Loyalty</strong>: Upon joining the Party, members swear an oath to uphold the Party’s principles, serve the people, and sacrifice for the communist cause.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. PRC Constitutional and Legal Obligations</strong></p>
<p>As public officials, the law enforcement personnel are also bound by the PRC Constitution and laws:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Constitutional Oath</strong>: The <em>Constitutional Oath of Office of China</em> (web IDs: 2, 6) requires state civil servants, including judicial personnel, to swear an oath to uphold the Constitution upon taking office, pledging to serve the people and the state.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Legal Standards</strong>: The <em>Criminal Procedure Law</em> (Article 53) requires that convictions be based on clear and sufficient evidence. The PRC Constitution (Article 35) guarantees freedom of speech, though this is often limited by public order and state security considerations (Article 51).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Context of Chen’s Case</strong></p>
<p>Chen was convicted for forwarding Twitter posts, including one from the U.S. Mission to China (<a class="reference external" href="https://x.com/USA_China_Talk">“美国驻华使领馆 US MissionCN”</a>), which the authorities deemed as spreading false information and disrupting public order. Chen argues that the handling of his case reflects misconduct by law enforcement personnel, both as Party members and public officials.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis of Chen Jingyuan’s Allegations</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Improper Conduct and Ideological Attacks</strong></p>
<p>Chen claims that law enforcement personnel berated him with the phrase “eating the Party’s food while smashing the Party’s pot,” implying disloyalty to the Party despite his non-membership.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Inappropriateness of the Accusation</strong>: The phrase “eating the Party’s food while smashing the Party’s pot” is a colloquial accusation of ingratitude and betrayal, typically directed at Party members or public officials who benefit from the Party’s system but act against its interests. Chen, as a non-Party member and independent scholar, does not fit this category. Using this rhetoric against him is factually inaccurate and inappropriate, as he has no formal obligation to the Party.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Violation of Party Discipline</strong>: The <em>2018 Disciplinary Regulations</em> emphasize that Party members must act justly and in accordance with procedures (web ID: 0). Berating a non-Party member with Party-specific rhetoric could be seen as unprofessional and a misuse of authority, potentially violating the Party’s expectation of disciplined conduct. However, this behavior does not directly contravene a specific Party regulation unless it involves corruption or abuse of power, which Chen does not explicitly allege here.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Legal Implications</strong>: As public officials, the personnel are bound by the <em>Criminal Procedure Law</em> to treat suspects with fairness and respect. Verbal abuse, if proven, could violate procedural justice principles, though Chen provides no specific evidence (e.g., recordings, witnesses) to substantiate this claim.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Chen’s allegation of ideological attacks is plausible given the political context of his case, where criticism of the Party (via forwarded Twitter posts) may have been interpreted as disloyalty. However, without concrete evidence of the verbal abuse, this claim remains anecdotal. The use of Party rhetoric against a non-member is inappropriate but does not clearly violate Party discipline unless it escalates to abuse of power.</p>
<p><strong>2. Misapplication of Party Discipline in Sentencing</strong></p>
<p>Chen asserts that his sentencing was based on CCP Party regulations and discipline, which he believes should not apply to him as a non-Party member.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Applicability of Party Discipline</strong>: The <em>2018 Disciplinary Regulations</em> (web ID: 0) apply only to Party members, not to non-members like Chen. Sentencing a non-Party member based on Party discipline would be a procedural error, as criminal cases must be adjudicated under PRC law (e.g., Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure Law), not Party rules. Chen’s conviction for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” should be based solely on Article 293 and the Two Highs Interpretation, which define the crime in terms of spreading false information and causing public disorder.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evidence of Misapplication</strong>: Chen claims the sentencing was “obviously” based on Party discipline, but he does not provide specific evidence (e.g., references to Party regulations in the judgment). The court’s judgment likely cites Article 293, as this is the legal basis for his conviction. However, if the court or prosecution explicitly invoked Party discipline (e.g., by referencing the Party Constitution or disciplinary sanctions in the sentencing rationale), this would be improper and a violation of the principle of legality (Article 3, PRC Criminal Law), which requires crimes and punishments to be defined by law, not Party rules.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Political Influence in Judicial Process</strong>: Chen’s case occurs in a context where the judiciary is heavily influenced by the Party, as seen in the emphasis on the “Two Safeguards” (web ID: 3), which prioritize Party leadership. The personnel may have interpreted Chen’s actions (forwarding a U.S. official’s speech critical of the CCP) as a challenge to Party authority, leading them to frame the case in ideological terms. This aligns with Chen’s broader claim of political motivation but does not necessarily mean Party discipline was formally applied in sentencing.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Chen’s allegation that Party discipline was used in his sentencing is serious but lacks direct evidence. If true, it would violate the principle of legality and the separation of Party and state functions in criminal justice. However, the more likely scenario is that the court used legal provisions (Article 293) while being influenced by Party ideology, which is common in politically sensitive cases but does not constitute a formal violation of Party regulations.</p>
<p><strong>3. Violation of Party Principles and Ideals</strong></p>
<p>Chen argues that the law enforcement personnel, as CCP members, failed to uphold the “Two Establishes” and “Two Safeguards,” their Party oath, and their constitutional oath. He accuses them of deceptive tactics, forming a “judicial gang,” and oppressing citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>“Two Establishes” and “Two Safeguards”</strong>: The “Two Establishes” (web ID: 3) affirm Xi Jinping’s leadership and thought, while the “Two Safeguards” protect his core status and the Party’s centralized authority. Chen’s case involves forwarding a Twitter post critical of the CCP, which the authorities may have viewed as undermining Party leadership. However, the personnel’s handling of the case—allegedly through deception and oppression—could be seen as contrary to the Party’s stated goals of “comprehensive rule of law” (全面依法治国) and “strict Party governance” (全面从严治党), which are part of Xi’s agenda. If the personnel fabricated evidence or abused power, as Chen alleges, this would undermine the Party’s legitimacy and public trust, potentially conflicting with the “Two Safeguards.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Party Oath</strong>: The Party oath requires members to serve the people and uphold the Party’s principles. Chen’s claim that the personnel oppressed taxpayers (their “providers”) suggests a failure to serve the people, which could violate the oath. However, the personnel likely viewed their actions as protecting the Party’s interests by suppressing dissent, aligning with their interpretation of Party loyalty.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Constitutional Oath</strong>: As public officials, the personnel swore to uphold the PRC Constitution (web IDs: 2, 6), which includes protecting citizens’ rights (e.g., freedom of speech, Article 35). Chen’s allegations of fabricated evidence (“捕风捉影”) and oppression (“残酷打压”) suggest violations of due process and constitutional rights, which would breach their oath. However, the Constitution also allows rights to be limited for public order (Article 51), which the personnel may argue justifies their actions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deceptive Tactics and “Low-Level Red, High-Level Black”</strong>: Chen’s accusation of “low-level red, high-level black” refers to superficial loyalty (e.g., claiming to protect the leader’s reputation) that masks subversive intent (e.g., undermining the Party’s broader goals). This is a serious charge, as it implies the personnel’s actions harm the Party’s image and mission. For example, if their handling of Chen’s case was perceived as unjust, it could fuel public discontent, contradicting the Party’s goal of maintaining stability.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Judicial Gang</strong>: Chen’s claim of a “judicial gang” (司法黑帮恶势力团伙) suggests collusion among law enforcement personnel to oppress citizens. If true, this would violate the <em>2018 Disciplinary Regulations</em> (web ID: 0), which prohibit Party members from interfering in judicial activities for personal gain (Article 127). However, Chen provides no specific evidence (e.g., communications, witness testimony) to support this claim.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Chen’s allegations of violating Party principles are partially supported by the context of his case. The personnel’s actions, if as oppressive as claimed, could undermine the Party’s goals of rule of law and public trust, conflicting with the “Two Safeguards” and their oaths. The “low-level red, high-level black” accusation is a rhetorical critique, reflecting Chen’s view that their actions harm the Party’s image, but it does not directly map to a specific Party regulation. The “judicial gang” claim is serious but unsubstantiated without evidence.</p>
<p><strong>4. Betrayal of CCP Policies and Ideals</strong></p>
<p>Chen alleges that the personnel’s actions negate key CCP policies, including market economy reforms, political system reforms, comprehensive rule of law, strict Party governance, “One Country, Two Systems,” and the “community with a shared future for mankind,” constituting a “complete betrayal” of the Party’s mission.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Undermining CCP Policies</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Market Economy and Political Reforms</strong>: Chen’s case does not directly relate to market economy or political reforms, but his prosecution for forwarding Twitter posts could be seen as stifling free expression, which some argue is necessary for innovation and reform. However, the Party often prioritizes stability over liberal reforms, so the personnel’s actions align with this approach.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comprehensive Rule of Law</strong>: The Party’s policy of “comprehensive rule of law” emphasizes legal governance, but Chen’s allegations of fabricated evidence and procedural violations (e.g., non-public trial, restricted defense rights) suggest a failure to uphold this principle. This could be seen as a betrayal of the Party’s stated commitment to legal reform.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Strict Party Governance</strong>: The <em>2018 Disciplinary Regulations</em> (web ID: 0) require Party members to adhere to strict discipline. If the personnel engaged in misconduct (e.g., abuse of power, collusion), this would violate the Party’s goal of self-regulation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>One Country, Two Systems and Community with a Shared Future</strong>: These policies are less directly relevant to Chen’s case. However, his prosecution could be seen as damaging the PRC’s international image, which might conflict with the “community with a shared future” narrative.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Betrayal of Ideals</strong>: Chen’s claim of “complete betrayal” is an exaggeration. The personnel likely viewed their actions as protecting the Party’s interests by suppressing dissent, which aligns with the Party’s emphasis on stability and control. However, if their methods were unjust, they may have inadvertently harmed the Party’s legitimacy, as Chen suggests.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Chen’s allegation that the personnel’s actions negate CCP policies has some merit, particularly regarding the rule of law. Their handling of the case, if as flawed as claimed, could undermine public trust and the Party’s legal reform agenda. However, the broader claim of betraying all listed policies is overstated, as the case primarily relates to domestic judicial conduct rather than international or economic policies.</p>
<p><strong>Overall Evaluation</strong></p>
<p>Chen Jingyuan’s allegations highlight significant concerns about the conduct of law enforcement personnel in his case, both as CCP members and public officials. Key findings include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Improper Conduct</strong>: The use of Party rhetoric against a non-member is inappropriate and potentially unprofessional, though it does not clearly violate Party regulations without evidence of abuse.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Misapplication of Party Discipline</strong>: If Party discipline was used in sentencing, this would be a legal error, but Chen provides no direct evidence. The influence of Party ideology in the judicial process is more likely, which is common in politically sensitive cases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Violation of Party Principles</strong>: The personnel’s alleged misconduct (e.g., oppression, deception) could undermine the Party’s goals of rule of law and public trust, conflicting with the “Two Safeguards” and their oaths. However, their actions may align with the Party’s priority of maintaining control.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Betrayal of Policies</strong>: The personnel’s actions may contradict the Party’s rule of law agenda, but the broader claim of negating all CCP policies is exaggerated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Chen’s allegations are partially valid, particularly regarding procedural fairness and the rule of law. The personnel’s conduct, if as described, could harm the Party’s image and goals, supporting Chen’s claim of “low-level red, high-level black” tactics. However, many of his accusations lack specific evidence, and the personnel likely viewed their actions as consistent with Party priorities (e.g., suppressing dissent). The case reflects broader tensions between the Party’s control mechanisms and its stated commitment to legal governance, highlighting systemic issues in the PRC’s judicial system.</p>
