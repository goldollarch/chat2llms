<p>Okay, here is a professional legal analysis and evaluation of  <a class="reference internal" href="../../../case/docus/Indictment/Indictment.html"><span class="doc std std-doc"><strong>the Indictment (Xi Jian Xing Su [2023] Z1)</strong></span></a> issued by the People’s Procuratorate of Xishan District, Kunming City, against Mr. Chen Jingyuan, based on this English version and cross-referenced with <a class="reference internal" href="../../../case/docus/Indictment/Indictment_cn.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">the Chinese original</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Analysis and Evaluation of the Indictment</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction:</strong></p>
<p>This analysis evaluates the Indictment No. Xi Jian Xing Su [2023] Z1, which formally charged Mr. Chen Jingyuan with the crime of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” under Article 293 of the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The Indictment was issued by the People’s Procuratorate of Xishan District, Kunming City, and served as the basis for initiating the criminal trial in the Xishan District People’s Court.</p>
<p><strong>2. Formal Sufficiency:</strong></p>
<p>From a procedural standpoint, the Indictment appears to meet the basic formal requirements outlined in the PRC Criminal Procedure Law:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>It correctly identifies the defendant (Chen Jingyuan) with personal details.</p></li>
<li><p>It clearly states the charge (“picking quarrels and provoking trouble”).</p></li>
<li><p>It provides a summary of the alleged criminal facts (using circumvention tools/chat tools to spread false statements online over a period, disrupting social order).</p></li>
<li><p>It cites the primary legal basis for the charge (Article 293 of the Criminal Law) and the procedural basis for initiating prosecution (Article 176 of the Criminal Procedure Law).</p></li>
<li><p>It lists the <em>categories</em> of evidence the prosecution intended to rely upon (physical, documentary, defendant’s confession/defense, expert opinions, investigation records, audio-visual/electronic data).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, listing evidence only by category, without specifying key items, limits any external assessment of the evidentiary strength at this stage.</p>
<p><strong>3. Analysis of Substantive Allegations:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Actus Reus (The Criminal Act):</strong> The Indictment alleges that Mr. Chen “used circumvention software to use chat tools to spread false statements on the information network.” This description is somewhat broad. While retweeting (the specific action mentioned in other documents) can be construed as “spreading,” the language lacks precision regarding the specific actions deemed criminal (e.g., number of posts, specific content). The explicit mention of “circumvention software” (翻墙软件), while factually relevant to accessing platforms like Twitter from China, might implicitly frame the defendant’s online activity as inherently suspect or illicit from the prosecution’s perspective.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mens Rea (Subjective Intent - “Knowingly”):</strong> The Indictment asserts that Mr. Chen acted “knowingly” (明知) when spreading the alleged false information. This is a crucial element for conviction under the relevant judicial interpretation for online rumor-mongering. However, the Indictment merely states this as a conclusion (“This Procuratorate believes that… knowingly spread…”) without providing any factual basis or reasoning within the document itself to support this claim of knowledge. This assertion remained to be proven by the prosecution at trial.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nature of Content (“False Statements”/”False Information”):</strong> The Indictment uses the terms “false statements” (虚假言论) in describing the facts and “false information” (虚假信息) when concluding the legal violation. Critically, it fails to specify <em>which</em> statements were allegedly false or <em>on what grounds</em> they were determined to be false. This lack of specificity is a significant weakness. It leaves open the possibility, later confirmed by the court judgments, that the “falsity” was determined based on the content’s political nature (criticism/insult of leaders/system) rather than objective factual inaccuracy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Consequence (“Disrupting Social Order”/”Causing Serious Disorder”):</strong> The factual description alleges the actions were “disrupting social order” (扰乱社会秩序), while the legal conclusion states they caused “serious disorder in public order” (造成公共秩序严重混乱). The latter reflects the higher threshold required by the Judicial Interpretation for criminal liability under Article 293 in this context. Similar to the element of “knowledge,” the Indictment simply asserts this consequence without providing any details of <em>how</em> this serious disorder manifested or was measured.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Evaluation of Legal Basis and Strength:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Legal Grounding:</strong> The prosecution correctly identifies Article 293 of the Criminal Law, as applied to online conduct via the 2013 Judicial Interpretation, as the legal basis for the charge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Claim of Sufficient Evidence:</strong> The Indictment confidently states that “The facts of the crime are clear, the evidence is reliable and sufficient.” However, the analysis above reveals that the allegations regarding the crucial elements of <em>mens rea</em> (“knowingly”) and <em>serious consequence</em> (“serious disorder”) are presented as bare assertions. This suggests the prosecution’s case might heavily rely on interpreting the act of retweeting sensitive political content itself as sufficient proof of both knowledge and inherent disruptiveness, rather than on direct evidence for these specific elements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Potential for Overreach:</strong> The combination of broad language, lack of specificity regarding the alleged “false information” and the resulting “disorder,” and the assertion of subjective knowledge without stated justification, raises concerns about potential prosecutorial overreach. The Indictment lays the groundwork for prosecuting online speech based on its political content under the umbrella of Article 293, potentially infringing upon freedom of expression.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>The Indictment against Mr. Chen Jingyuan fulfills the formal procedural requirements for initiating a criminal prosecution in the PRC. However, its substantive allegations, particularly concerning the defendant’s subjective knowledge (“knowingly”) and the occurrence of “serious public disorder,” are presented as conclusory statements lacking specific factual grounding within the document itself. The failure to specify the nature of the alleged “false information” or the manifestation of the “serious disorder” indicates potential weaknesses in the case’s foundation regarding these core legal elements.</p>
<p>Overall, the Indictment reflects a prosecutorial approach where engaging in online activity involving politically sensitive content, accessed via circumvention tools, is readily framed as a criminal act under the broad scope of Article 293 (“picking quarrels and provoking trouble”). It sets the stage for a trial where the focus might be less on rigorous proof of all legal elements and more on penalizing expression deemed undesirable by the state.</p>
