Objective Criminal Conduct
===========================

Based on several police interrogations and preliminary summary, the defendant have identified 
the alleged "rumors" primarily as the following four categories of online posts in his 
:doc:`self-defense and accusation </case/letters/Prison/Letter>`. 

(1) The first category of posts consists of **artistic works**. 

(2) The second category of reposts involves the expression of **personal subjective emotions**.

(3) The third category involves the **rational understanding of objective reality**.

(4) Some **historical materials and descriptions of current realities**.

The above categories of posts cover all the "criminal evidence" extracted by the police 
for this case. In fact, they respectively describe the creation and appreciation of artistic works, 
the expression of personal subjective emotions, rational understanding, and the description of objective reality, 
which are basically a relatively complete classification of the content of human spiritual life.

But, when considering the specific content of these posts, it's easy to see that these posts are clearly not "rumors." 
(To date, all these posts **still exist online** and are **publicly accessible**, and 
any **official refutation or clarification** have never been seen.)
