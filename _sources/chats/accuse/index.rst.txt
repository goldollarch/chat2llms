Accuse the Judicial Mafia
===========================


In his :doc:`self-defense and accusation </case/letters/Prison/Letter>`, the defendant Dr. Chen Jingyuan alleges that the Kunming judicial authorities fabricated an unjust case against him for "picking quarrels and provoking trouble.". He writed as follows:


- In summary, the accusations and sentencing against me by the Kunming judicial mafia, with Ge Bin, Pu Huijun, Li Xiangyun, and others as their henchmen and thugs, have no support from any objective, concrete evidence of criminal activity, nor do they comply with relevant legal provisions. This is a completely fabricated, unjust case, maliciously concocted. Moreover, this judicial mafia is not only persecuting and committing crimes against me personally; their actions are, to a greater extent, crimes against the nation, the people, and even the entire world and humanity.
