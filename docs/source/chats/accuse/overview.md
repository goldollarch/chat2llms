Overview of the accusations
============================

Below is a professional legal analysis and evaluation of the accusations made by Dr. Chen Jingyuan in his [*Self-Defense and Accusation from Prison*](/case/letters/Prison/Letter) regarding the actions of the Kunming judicial authorities, whom he labels a \"judicial mafia\" involving prosecutor Ge Bin, Pu Huijun, Li Xiangyun, and others. The analysis is grounded in the *Criminal Law of the People\'s Republic of China*, the *Criminal Procedure Law*, the *Constitution of the People\'s Republic of China*, the *Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Constitution*, the *CCP Disciplinary Regulations*, and relevant judicial interpretations. It evaluates the legal basis of Chen's accusations, the actions of the judicial authorities, and the broader implications for the legal and political system in China.

**Overview of Chen Jingyuan's Accusations**

Dr. Chen Jingyuan alleges that the Kunming judicial authorities fabricated an unjust case against him for \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble.\" His specific accusations include:

1.  **Lack of Evidence and Legal Basis**: The accusations and sentencing against him lack objective evidence of criminal activity and do not comply with legal provisions, making the case a fabricated, maliciously concocted injustice.

2.  **Crimes Against Broader Entities**: The judicial mafia's actions are crimes not only against Chen personally but also against the nation, the people, the world, and humanity.

3.  **Specific Criminal Acts**:

    - Large-scale violations of China's *Criminal Law* and related laws.

    - Comprehensive infringement and trampling of citizens' constitutional rights.

    - Comprehensive violation and denial of the CCP's lines, principles, and policies.

    - Violation of CCP rules and discipline.

**Legal Analysis and Evaluation**

**1. Lack of Evidence and Legal Basis for the Case**

- **Chen's Allegation**:

  - Chen claims that the accusations and sentencing against him lack objective evidence of criminal activity and do not comply with legal provisions, making the case a fabricated, unjust prosecution.

- **Legal Context**:

  - **Article 293 of the *Criminal Law***: The crime of \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\" requires \"serious disruption to public order.\" For online dissemination, the *Interpretation of the Supreme People\'s Court and Supreme People\'s Procuratorate on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Handling Criminal Cases of Defamation and Other Crimes Committed via Information Networks* (*Two Highs Interpretation*, Article 5) requires proof of \"fabricated information\" and quantitative thresholds (e.g., 500 retweets or 5,000 views) to establish \"serious disruption.\"

  - **Article 53 of the *Criminal Procedure Law***: Evidence must be verified and reliable to form the basis of a conviction.

  - **Article 195 of the *Criminal Procedure Law***: Convictions must be based on \"clear facts and sufficient evidence.\" If evidence is insufficient, the defendant must be acquitted.

  - **Article 399 of the *Criminal Law***: Judicial personnel who \"pervert the law for personal gain\" by knowingly convicting an innocent person face criminal liability, with penalties including imprisonment.

- **Evaluation**:

  - **Lack of Evidence**: Chen's retweets (fewer than 100, with fewer than 100 followers, as noted in prior statements) did not meet the *Two Highs Interpretation*'s thresholds for \"serious disruption\" (500 retweets or 5,000 views). The prosecution also failed to prove the \"falsity\" of the retweeted content (e.g., art pieces, news reports, Trump's speech), as required by Article 5. There is no evidence that Chen \"knew\" the content was false, violating Article 55 of the *Criminal Procedure Law*, which requires proof of subjective intent. Chen's prior statements (e.g., a prosecutor admitting the evidence was \"not even illegal, let alone a criminal offense\") further support this claim.

  - **Non-Compliance with Legal Provisions**: The absence of evidence means the conviction violates Article 195 of the *Criminal Procedure Law*, which mandates acquittal if evidence is insufficient. The prosecution's reliance on unverified claims (e.g., Ge Bin's refusal to verify posts published on CCTV and *Guangming Daily*, as noted in Chen's other statements) violates Article 53, rendering the case procedurally invalid.

  - **Fabrication and Injustice**: Chen's claim of a \"completely fabricated, unjust case\" is substantiated by the lack of evidence meeting the legal requirements for \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble.\" The prosecution's pursuit of the case despite this deficiency, combined with \"special instructions\" from \"higher-level leaders\" (mentioned in Chen's other statements) to make the case an \"ironclad case,\" suggests a politically motivated fabrication. This undermines judicial independence (Article 6 of the *Criminal Procedure Law*), supporting Chen's claim of a maliciously concocted case.

**2. Crimes Against the Nation, People, World, and Humanity**

- **Chen's Allegation**:

  - Chen asserts that the judicial mafia's actions are crimes not only against him but also against the nation, the people, the world, and humanity.

- **Legal Context**:

  - **Article 13 of the *Criminal Law***: Crimes are acts that \"endanger the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the state,\" \"disrupt social order,\" or \"infringe upon the rights of citizens.\"

  - **Article 1 of the *Criminal Procedure Law***: The law aims to ensure accurate punishment of crimes, protect the innocent, and safeguard citizens' legal rights.

  - **International Human Rights Standards**: Web result \[web:0\] (*United States Department of State*) notes that actions like arbitrary detention and suppression of dissent violate international human rights norms, such as freedom of expression (Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19).

- **Evaluation**:

  - **Against the Nation**: By fabricating a case against Chen, the judicial authorities undermine the rule of law, a key pillar of national governance under Xi Jinping's \"comprehensive rule of law\" policy. This erodes public trust in the legal system, potentially destabilizing social order, which aligns with Article 13's definition of crimes that \"disrupt social order.\"

  - **Against the People**: Chen, as a citizen, was deprived of his legal rights (e.g., fair trial, freedom of expression), violating Article 1 of the *Criminal Procedure Law*'s purpose to protect citizens' rights. Web result \[web:0\] documents similar cases (e.g., Chen Yunfei's detention for commemorating Tiananmen victims), indicating a pattern of targeting individuals to suppress dissent, which harms the broader populace by stifling diverse perspectives.

  - **Against the World and Humanity**: Chen's retweets included foreign content (e.g., Trump's speech), and labeling such content as \"rumors\" risks diplomatic tensions, as it could be perceived as an attack on foreign leaders. Suppressing cultural exchange (e.g., art pieces, news reports) contradicts Xi Jinping's \"community with a shared future for mankind\" policy, which emphasizes global cultural dialogue. Internationally, the violation of Chen's freedom of expression aligns with human rights concerns, as noted in web result \[web:0\], where similar cases of repression are criticized.

  - **Assessment**: Chen's claim of \"crimes against the nation, people, world, and humanity\" has some legal grounding domestically (e.g., disrupting social order, violating citizens' rights) and internationally (e.g., human rights violations). However, the \"world and humanity\" aspect is more rhetorical and less directly actionable under Chinese law, though it resonates with global human rights frameworks.

**3. Large-Scale Violations of China's Criminal Law and Related Laws**

- **Chen's Allegation**:

  - Chen accuses the judicial mafia of large-scale violations of the *Criminal Law* and related laws.

- **Legal Context**:

  - **Article 399 of the *Criminal Law***: Judicial personnel who \"pervert the law for personal gain\" (e.g., knowingly convicting an innocent person) face imprisonment.

  - **Article 405 of the *Criminal Law***: Judicial personnel who engage in \"wandering from the course of justice\" (e.g., fabricating evidence) can be punished with imprisonment.

  - **Article 6 of the *Criminal Procedure Law***: Judicial personnel must act independently and in accordance with the law, free from interference.

  - **Article 183 of the *Criminal Procedure Law***: Trials must be public unless specific exceptions apply (e.g., state secrets).

- **Evaluation**:

  - **Perverting the Law**: The prosecution's pursuit of Chen's case despite insufficient evidence (e.g., failure to prove \"falsity\" or \"serious disruption\") and the prosecutor's admission (in Chen's other statements) that the case was \"not even illegal\" suggest a knowing violation of the law. This aligns with Article 399's definition of \"perverting the law for personal gain,\" as the authorities pursued a baseless conviction, potentially under external pressure (e.g., \"special instructions\" from \"higher-level leaders\").

  - **Fabrication of Evidence**: Chen's claim of fabricated evidence is supported by the prosecution's reliance on unverified claims of \"rumors,\" despite the posts being published on official platforms like CCTV (as noted in Chen's other statements). This could constitute \"wandering from the course of justice\" under Article 405.

  - **Procedural Violations**: The non-public trial (mentioned in Chen's other statements) violates Article 183 of the *Criminal Procedure Law*, as no exception (e.g., state secrets) appears applicable. The restriction of Chen's defense rights (e.g., being told to \"shut up\" in court) violates Article 14 of the *Criminal Procedure Law*.

  - **Interference with Judicial Independence**: The \"special instructions\" from \"higher-level leaders\" violate Article 6 of the *Criminal Procedure Law*, which prohibits interference in judicial proceedings.

  - **Assessment**: Chen's accusation of large-scale violations of the *Criminal Law* and related laws is well-supported. The judicial authorities' actions---pursuing a baseless case, fabricating evidence, violating procedural laws, and succumbing to external interference---constitute multiple legal violations, potentially amounting to criminal acts under Articles 399 and 405.

**4. Comprehensive Infringement of Constitutional Rights**

- **Chen's Allegation**:

  - Chen claims that the judicial mafia comprehensively infringed upon and trampled his constitutional rights as a citizen.

- **Legal Context**:

  - **Article 35 of the *Constitution***: Citizens have the right to freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, procession, and demonstration.

  - **Article 41 of the *Constitution***: Citizens have the right to criticize and make suggestions regarding state organs and their functionaries.

  - **Article 33 of the *Constitution***: The state respects and protects human rights.

  - **Article 14 of the *Criminal Procedure Law***: Defendants have the right to a defense.

- **Evaluation**:

  - **Freedom of Speech**: Chen's retweets of art pieces, news reports, and Trump's speech constitute an exercise of freedom of speech under Article 35. The prosecution's labeling of this content as \"rumors\" and subsequent conviction suppress this right, especially since the content did not meet the legal threshold for \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble.\"

  - **Right to Criticize**: Chen's retweets included critical content (e.g., Xu Zhangrun's dismissal), aligning with Article 41's right to criticize state organs. Suppressing this speech through a fabricated case violates this right.

  - **Right to a Fair Trial**: Chen's reports of being told to \"shut up\" in court (in other statements) and the non-public trial violate Article 14 of the *Criminal Procedure Law* and Article 183, denying him a fair trial.

  - **Human Rights**: The arbitrary conviction and suppression of Chen's speech violate Article 33's mandate to protect human rights, aligning with web result \[web:0\]'s documentation of similar violations (e.g., arbitrary detention).

  - **Assessment**: Chen's accusation of constitutional rights violations is substantiated. The judicial authorities' actions suppressed his freedom of speech, right to criticize, and right to a fair trial, constituting a comprehensive infringement of his constitutional rights.

**5. Comprehensive Violation of CCP Lines, Principles, and Policies**

- **Chen's Allegation**:

  - Chen claims that the judicial mafia comprehensively violated and denied the CCP's lines, principles, and policies.

- **Legal Context**:

  - **CCP Policies**:

    - **Comprehensive Rule of Law**: Xi Jinping's policy emphasizes adherence to law and judicial fairness.

    - **Community with a Shared Future for Mankind**: Promotes cultural exchange and global dialogue.

    - **Socialist Democracy**: Advocates for allowing constructive criticism.

  - **Article 56 of the *CCP Disciplinary Regulations***: Party members must not violate the Party's lines, principles, and policies.

- **Evaluation**:

  - **Comprehensive Rule of Law**: The judicial authorities' fabrication of the case, disregard for evidence (e.g., Ge Bin's refusal to verify posts), and external interference (e.g., \"special instructions\") violate Xi Jinping's \"comprehensive rule of law\" policy, which demands adherence to legal standards.

  - **Community with a Shared Future for Mankind**: Chen's retweets included foreign content (e.g., Trump's speech), and suppressing this cultural exchange contradicts the policy's emphasis on global dialogue.

  - **Socialist Democracy**: Targeting Chen for critical content (e.g., Xu Zhangrun's dismissal) suppresses constructive criticism, undermining socialist democracy.

  - **Assessment**: Chen's claim is substantiated. The judicial authorities' actions violate key CCP policies by undermining the rule of law, suppressing cultural exchange, and stifling criticism, potentially constituting a violation of Article 56 of the *CCP Disciplinary Regulations*.

**6. Violation of CCP Rules and Discipline**

- **Chen's Allegation**:

  - Chen accuses the judicial mafia of violating CCP rules and discipline.

- **Legal Context**:

  - **Article 3 of the *CCP Constitution***: Party members must \"uphold the Party's lines, principles, and policies,\" \"serve the people wholeheartedly,\" and \"fight against corruption.\"

  - **Article 132 of the *CCP Disciplinary Regulations***: Party members must not abuse their power to oppress or frame others.

  - **Article 57 of the *CCP Disciplinary Regulations***: Party members must not engage in acts that damage the Party's image.

- **Evaluation**:

  - **Abuse of Power**: The judicial authorities' pursuit of a baseless case against Chen, including fabricating evidence and ignoring legal standards, constitutes an abuse of power under Article 132. This is compounded by external interference from \"higher-level leaders,\" which violates the principle of independent judicial action.

  - **Failure to Serve the People**: By targeting Chen, a taxpayer and scholar, with a fabricated case, the authorities failed to \"serve the people wholeheartedly,\" as required by Article 3 of the *CCP Constitution*.

  - **Damage to Party Image**: The judicial misconduct, including Ge Bin's admission of acting against his conscience (in Chen's other statements), damages the Party's image by undermining public trust in its governance, violating Article 57.

  - **Assessment**: Chen's accusation of violations of CCP rules and discipline is well-founded. The judicial authorities' actions---abusing power, failing to serve the people, and damaging the Party's image---constitute multiple breaches of Party discipline.

**7. Broader Implications**

- **Rule of Law**: The judicial mafia's actions undermine Xi Jinping's \"comprehensive rule of law\" policy, as noted in web result \[web:3\], which highlights systemic issues like local interference in judicial processes.

- **Human Rights Concerns**: The misuse of \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\" to target Chen aligns with cases like those of Chen Yunfei (web result \[web:0\]), raising concerns about freedom of expression and arbitrary detention.

- **Public Trust**: Web result \[web:0\] notes that external interventions erode judicial fairness. The actions of the Kunming authorities further damage public trust in the legal system.

- **Diplomatic Risks**: Suppressing Chen's retweets of foreign content (e.g., Trump's speech) risks diplomatic tensions, as it could be seen as an attack on foreign leaders.

**Conclusion**

Dr. Chen Jingyuan's accusations against the Kunming judicial authorities are largely substantiated by legal and procedural evidence:

- The case lacks evidence and legal basis, violating Articles 195 and 53 of the *Criminal Procedure Law*, and may constitute \"perverting the law for personal gain\" under Article 399 of the *Criminal Law*.

- The judicial actions infringe upon Chen's constitutional rights (e.g., freedom of speech, fair trial) under Articles 35, 41, and 33 of the *Constitution*.

- The authorities violated CCP policies (e.g., comprehensive rule of law, socialist democracy) and Party discipline (e.g., Articles 132 and 57 of the *CCP Disciplinary Regulations*).

- While Chen's claim of \"crimes against the nation, people, world, and humanity\" is partly rhetorical, it has some legal basis domestically (e.g., disrupting social order) and internationally (e.g., human rights violations).

The case reflects systemic issues in China's judicial system, including lack of independence, misuse of vague laws, and external interference, which undermine the rule of law, public trust, and human rights. If Chen's allegations are true, the involved personnel (Ge Bin, Pu Huijun, Li Xiangyun, and others) should face investigation for judicial corruption and potential criminal liability under the *Criminal Law* and *CCP Disciplinary Regulations*.

This evaluation is based on Chen's allegations and case documents as of March 23, 2025. Further investigation into procedural details may be warranted but is beyond the scope of this analysis.
