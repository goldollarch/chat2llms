=========================================

**Analysis of the Legal Basis, Deficiencies, and Shortcomings of the Kunming Public Security, Procuratorate, and Court System Using a Forwarded Candlelight Memorial Image as Evidence for Chen Jingyuan's "Picking Quarrels and Provoking Trouble" Charge**

**Case Background Overview**

Dr. Chen Jingyuan was arrested and convicted by the Kunming public security, procuratorate, and court system (hereinafter referred to as the \"Kunming authorities\") for the crime of \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\" under Article 293 of the *Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China* due to his forwarding of Twitter posts. One of the key pieces of evidence cited was a candlelight memorial image that Chen forwarded on June 4th of a certain year, which the Kunming authorities used as evidence of his alleged crime. Below, I will analyze the legal basis for this action, as well as the deficiencies and shortcomings in the Kunming authorities' approach, from the perspectives of legal principles and evidence usage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**I. Analysis of the Legal Basis for the Kunming Authorities Using the Forwarded Candlelight Memorial Image as Evidence for "Picking Quarrels and Provoking Trouble"**

**1. Legal Elements of "Picking Quarrels and Provoking Trouble"**

According to Article 293 of the *Criminal Law*, the crime of \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\" requires the following elements:

- **Actus Reus**: The act of \"disseminating false information\" or \"causing a disturbance in a public place.\"

- **Consequence**: Causing serious disruption to public order.

- **Mens Rea**: The intent to commit the act.

- **Quantitative Standard for Online Dissemination**: The 2013 *Interpretation of the Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Handling Criminal Cases of Defamation and Other Acts via Information Networks* (hereinafter referred to as the *Two Highs Interpretation*) Article 5 specifies that disseminating false information online must result in significant consequences, such as being retweeted 500 times or viewed 5,000 times, or causing other severe outcomes (e.g., triggering mass incidents) to constitute a crime.

**2. Possible Legal Basis for the Kunming Authorities' Actions**

The Kunming authorities may have relied on the following legal grounds to use Chen Jingyuan's forwarding of the candlelight memorial image as evidence for \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\":

- **Determination of "Disseminating False Information"**: The authorities might have deemed the candlelight memorial image related to the \"June 4th Incident\" as \"sensitive\" or \"false,\" given the official stance on the event. If the image was classified as a \"rumor\" or \"false information,\" it could be argued to meet the \"disseminating false information\" element under Article 293 of the *Criminal Law*.

- **Presumption of "Serious Disruption to Public Order"**: The authorities might have presumed that forwarding such an image could provoke social unrest, especially on the sensitive date of June 4th, potentially \"disrupting public order.\"

- **Assessment of Subjective Intent**: The authorities might have argued that Chen Jingyuan, knowing the sensitivity of the \"June 4th\" topic, still chose to forward the image, demonstrating subjective intent to \"pick quarrels and provoke trouble.\"

- **Application of Constitutional Restrictions**: Article 51 of the *Constitution of the People's Republic of China* (hereinafter referred to as the *Constitution*) states that citizens, in exercising their freedoms and rights, must not harm the interests of the state, society, the collective, or the lawful rights of other citizens. The authorities might have argued that Chen's forwarding harmed national interests or social stability.

**3. Reasonableness of the Legal Basis**

- **Issue with Determining "Disseminating False Information"**: Candlelight memorial images are typically expressions of emotion or commemoration, not necessarily involving factual statements, let alone \"false information.\" The *Two Highs Interpretation* defines \"false information\" as fabricated facts (e.g., fake disaster reports), not emotional or symbolic expressions. If the authorities failed to prove the image's content was false and directly classified it as a \"rumor,\" this lacks legal grounding.

- **Lack of Evidence for "Serious Disruption to Public Order"**: The authorities did not provide evidence that Chen's forwarding caused a \"serious disruption to public order.\" The *Two Highs Interpretation* requires proof of quantifiable consequences (e.g., 500 retweets or 5,000 views), but no such data was presented in this case, making the authorities' presumption baseless.

- **Issue with Assessing Subjective Intent**: Chen's forwarding of the image may have been a personal emotional expression, not necessarily indicative of intent to \"pick quarrels and provoke trouble.\" If the authorities presumed intent solely due to the sensitivity of the \"June 4th\" topic, this may constitute subjective speculation.

- **Application of Article 51 of the *Constitution***: While Article 51 allows for restrictions on citizens' rights, such restrictions must be lawful, necessary, and proportionate. The authorities failed to demonstrate how Chen's forwarding specifically harmed national interests, and directly applying this provision to restrict his freedom of speech may be unlawful.

**Conclusion**: The legal basis for the Kunming authorities' use of the forwarded candlelight memorial image as evidence for \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\" is tenuous. It does not adequately meet the elements of Article 293 of the *Criminal Law* or the *Two Highs Interpretation*, indicating flaws in legal application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**II. Deficiencies and Shortcomings in the Kunming Authorities' Approach**

**1. Lack of Relevance of the Evidence**

**Issue**:

- The candlelight memorial image is an emotional or symbolic expression, not a factual statement, and does not possess the characteristics of a \"rumor\" or \"false information.\" Chen merely forwarded the image without adding comments or taking a clear stance, making it impossible to prove he engaged in \"disseminating false information.\"

- The authorities failed to provide evidence that the image's content was false or that Chen's forwarding was directly related to the actus reus of \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble.\"

**Legal Basis**:

- Article 50 of the *Criminal Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China* (hereinafter referred to as the *CPL*) requires that evidence be directly related to the facts of the case. The candlelight memorial image, as an emotional expression, is unrelated to \"disseminating false information\" and lacks relevance to the actus reus of \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble.\"

- Article 5 of the *Two Highs Interpretation* requires proof of dissemination and its consequences, which the authorities failed to provide.

**Conclusion**: The authorities' use of the candlelight memorial image as evidence lacks relevance, as it does not prove Chen committed the actus reus of \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble.\"

**2. Insufficient Evidence**

**Issue**:

- The authorities did not provide evidence that Chen's forwarding caused a \"serious disruption to public order.\" The case does not mention the image's retweet count, view count, or specific social impact, and the authorities relied solely on presumption to convict.

- The authorities failed to prove the image's content was \"false information\" and did not provide evidence of official refutation or clarification.

**Legal Basis**:

- Article 53 of the *CPL* requires that a conviction be based on clear and sufficient evidence, ruling out reasonable doubt. The authorities provided no dissemination data or evidence of consequences, making the conviction evidence insufficient.

- Article 5 of the *Two Highs Interpretation* requires proof of quantifiable consequences (e.g., 500 retweets or 5,000 views), which the authorities failed to meet.

**Conclusion**: The authorities' reliance on the candlelight memorial image as evidence fails to meet the sufficiency requirement under Article 53 of the *CPL*, as the evidence chain is incomplete.

**3. Disregard for Constitutional Protection of Free Speech**

**Issue**:

- Forwarding the candlelight memorial image is an emotional expression by Chen, falling within the scope of free speech protected by the *Constitution*. The authorities' classification of this act as \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\" may infringe on Chen's constitutional rights.

- The authorities failed to demonstrate how Chen's forwarding specifically harmed national interests or social stability, directly restricting his free speech without proving the necessity of such a restriction.

**Legal Basis**:

- Article 35 of the *Constitution* guarantees citizens' freedom of speech, and forwarding a candlelight memorial image falls within the scope of speech.

- Article 51 of the *Constitution* allows for restrictions on rights, but such restrictions must be lawful, necessary, and proportionate. The authorities did not provide sufficient evidence to justify the restriction.

**Conclusion**: The authorities disregarded the protection of free speech under Article 35 of the *Constitution* and failed to prove the necessity of restricting Chen's rights, potentially infringing on his constitutional rights.

**4. Disregard for the Universality of Emotional Expression**

**Issue**:

- The candlelight memorial image is an emotional expression reflecting a common human psychological response to historical events, such as commemoration. The authorities' classification of this as \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\" disregards the universality of emotional expression.

- The authorities failed to consider the emotional significance of \"June 4th\" candlelight memorials in certain communities (e.g., the Victoria Park candlelight vigil in Hong Kong, web ID: 2), directly labeling it as criminal evidence without reasonable grounds.

**Legal Basis**:

- Article 35 of the *Constitution* guarantees freedom of speech, and emotional expressions fall within this scope.

- Psychological research confirms that emotional expression is a universal feature of human psychological activity (web ID: 0), and the authorities' disregard for this universality lacks scientific basis.

**Conclusion**: The authorities disregarded the universality and cultural context of emotional expression, criminalizing a normal psychological activity, which lacks legal and scientific grounding.

**5. Lack of Procedural Justice**

**Issue**:

- The authorities did not thoroughly verify the dissemination scope or social impact of the candlelight memorial image, directly classifying it as evidence for \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\" without a transparent evidence collection and classification process.

- The authorities did not explain how they determined the image to be \"false information\" or provide evidence of official refutations or clarifications.

**Legal Basis**:

- Article 2 of the *CPL* mandates that criminal proceedings ensure the correct implementation of the law and protect citizens' rights. The authorities' failure to carefully verify evidence may violate procedural justice.

- Article 116 of the *CPL* requires a detention warrant for arrests, and Article 119 mandates notifying the family within 24 hours of detention. If the authorities failed to follow arrest procedures, this would constitute a further violation.

**Conclusion**: The authorities lacked transparency and diligence in evidence verification and conviction procedures, potentially violating the procedural justice requirements of the *CPL*.

**6. Potential Political Motivation**

**Issue**:

- The \"June 4th\" candlelight memorial image involves a politically sensitive topic, and the authorities may have been driven by political sensitivity to classify it as evidence for \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble,\" rather than basing their actions on legal facts.

- The authorities failed to provide dissemination data or evidence of consequences, suggesting the conviction may have been politically motivated.

**Legal Basis**:

- Article 5 of the *Constitution* mandates the rule of law, and no organization or individual may act above the *Constitution* and laws. Law enforcement must be based on legal facts, not political considerations.

- Article 12 of the *CPL* states that no one may be deemed guilty without a court judgment. The authorities' conviction with insufficient evidence may violate the principle of presumption of innocence.

**Conclusion**: The authorities may have been influenced by political motives, failing to act in accordance with the law, raising concerns of potential abuse of power.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Overall Assessment**

**Legal Basis Analysis**: The Kunming authorities' use of Chen Jingyuan's forwarded candlelight memorial image as evidence for \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\" has a tenuous legal basis. The authorities may have presumed the image to be \"false information\" and disruptive to public order due to the sensitivity of the \"June 4th\" topic, but they failed to provide dissemination data or evidence of consequences, falling short of the elements required by Article 293 of the *Criminal Law* and the *Two Highs Interpretation*. This indicates flaws in legal application.

**Deficiencies and Shortcomings**:

- **Lack of Evidence Relevance**: The candlelight memorial image is an emotional expression, unrelated to \"disseminating false information,\" and lacks relevance to the actus reus of \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble.\"

- **Insufficient Evidence**: The authorities failed to provide dissemination data or evidence of consequences, rendering the conviction evidence insufficient.

- **Disregard for Constitutional Protections**: The authorities failed to justify the necessity of restricting free speech, potentially infringing on Chen's constitutional rights.

- **Disregard for Emotional Universality**: The authorities criminalized a normal psychological activity, lacking scientific grounding.

- **Lack of Procedural Justice**: The authorities lacked transparency and diligence in evidence verification, violating procedural justice.

- **Potential Political Motivation**: The authorities may have been driven by political sensitivity, failing to act in accordance with the law.

**Final Conclusion**: The Kunming authorities' use of Chen Jingyuan's forwarded candlelight memorial image as evidence for \"picking quarrels and provoking trouble\" lacks a solid legal basis, failing to meet the elements of Article 293 of the *Criminal Law* and the *Two Highs Interpretation*. The conviction lacks sufficient evidence and exhibits deficiencies in evidence relevance, sufficiency, constitutional protection, emotional universality, and procedural justice. The authorities may have been influenced by political motives, potentially infringing on Chen's freedom of speech under Article 35 of the *Constitution*. This case highlights the tension between the handling of sensitive topics and the protection of constitutional rights in China's judicial practice.
